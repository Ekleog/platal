# List of security fixes that have been committed to the "master" branch.
# This list is used to programmatically determine if a checkout of plat/al has
# known vulnerabilities (which is useful for automatically disabling an unused
# and unsafe checkout).
#
# In order to guarantee that only patched checkouts do have an updated SECURITY
# file, updates of this file should be done within the same sommit that actually
# fixes the security issue. Since the commit id is not known yet, it can be
# replaced by '00000000', and updated later.
#
# Format: <date> <commit id> <commit description>
# The commit id should refer to the id in the "master" branch, if the initial
# commit in a version branch had another name.
