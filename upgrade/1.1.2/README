Check that the following queries return the same results before updating:
SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT(pid)) FROM profile_name AS pn INNER JOIN profile_name_enum AS pne ON (pn.typeid = pne.id) WHERE pne.type = 'nickname';
SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT(pid)) FROM profile_name AS pn INNER JOIN profile_name_enum AS pne ON (pn.typeid = pne.id) WHERE pne.type = 'name_other';
SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT(pid)) FROM profile_name AS pn INNER JOIN profile_name_enum AS pne ON (pn.typeid = pne.id) WHERE pne.type = 'firstname_other';

Once all sql/php scripts have be run, run retrieve_address_tables.sh and finally xx_retrieve_geocoding.sql.
Then "./formatAddresses.php -g -t g -r e" will format the last ungeocoded addresses.
