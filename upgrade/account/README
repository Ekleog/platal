Database structure:
-------------------

* plat/al uses a single database instead of 5. The new database is built from scratch and *must* not be x4dat.
* most tables of the database are prefixed by the category of the table:
 - account -> related to user account (identifier master, password, permissions)
 - profile -> related to the directory
 - email, aliases, virtual -> related to email management
 - group -> related to X.net
 - forum -> related to innd and banana
 - ...
* some table does not follow this convention and may be renamed in the future.

* account identifiers are called uid (hruid for a human readable identifier for display purpose)
* profile identifiers are called pid (hrpid for a human readable identifier for display purpose)

* most tables have been switched to innodb in order to use foreign keys in a future release.


Configuration changes:
----------------------

* Core.dbdb must be set to the name of the new database.
* Banana.table_prefix is deprecated

Affected services:
------------------

News:
* authentication must use account + account_types with weakpass.
* forums base dropped and moved to forum_ namespace.


Email:
* auth_user_md5.smtppass -> accounts.weak_password. This password is NULL when empty, but a check must be added for empty passwords.
* auth_user_md5.mail_storage -> email_options.storage
* aliases.id -> aliases.uid
* virtual* and emails should be unchanged
